Directed cell signaling pathways are collected from the KEGG database, CST Pathways database, and so on.

* __data__: files of pathways from [IntPath](http://compbio.ddns.comp.nus.edu.sg:8080/IntPath/index.html) and [KEGG](http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html)
* __doc__: list of pathways included in pathway files
* __src__: 2 functions for extracting upstream or downstream genes; 1 function for merging pathway files
