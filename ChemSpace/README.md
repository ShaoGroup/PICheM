## ChemSpace

ChemSpace is used to extract compounds' information:  
1. Physico-chemistry information.  
2. Fingerprints information.  
3. Calculation of chemical similarities.  

Since compounds are too much large, we only upload our demo script to explain
how we deal with these information. Now our scripts are mainly depend on the
python package **RDKit**.  
1. For RDKit usage, see "ComFeatureExtract_RDkit.py"
2. For PubChem fingerprints, see "pubchem_similarity_calc.py"
